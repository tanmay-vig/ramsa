                        Mathematics plays a key role in the development of
                        modern sciences, engineering, management and many other
                        important areas of activities. With this aim in mind the
                        Department of Mathematics was established from the very
                        inception with a Vision to attain excellence in teaching
                        and research and become a leader in the field of
                        mathematics and its applications. Besides catering to
                        the basic needs of the various B. Tech., M. Tech. and
                        Ph. D. programs of the Institute, it had a strong fervor
                        towards research and development. The Department has a
                        good blend of pure and applied mathematicians, which
                        provides a vibrant research atmosphere. The
                        specializations of the faculty members cover most of the
                        important and emerging areas of Mathematics. The
                        Department is also actively involved in its own research
                        and development activities through its B.Sc., M.Sc. and
                        Ph.D. Programs.

                The aim of this conference is to bring together learned
                mathematicians, scientists, engineers, researchers from industry
                and research scholars working in the different areas of
                mathematics at a common platform. The Conference provides an
                excellent opportunity to researchers, practitioners and
                educators to present and discuss the recent innovations in
                mathematics for potential implementation in sciences and
                engineering. It focuses on strengthening the existing results
                along with identifying the practical challenges encountered with
                respect to various solutions adopted in the fields of
                Mathematics and its Applications. Moreover, it will provide an
                opportunity to enhance collaboration among researchers not only
                from the various parts of the country but also with those from
                abroad. The scientific program will consist of
                Keynote/plenary/invited lectures and parallel sessions for
                contributed presentations. The main emphasis will be on the
                vibrant implicational aspects of applied mathematics for
                cultivating contemporary and advanced findings in
                multidimensional sphere of engineering and sciences. The invited
                lectures and refereed contributed papers will be published in
                the proceedings after due reviewing process by the committee of
                experts in various disciplines. The conference proceedings of
                the previous series of RAMSA were published by <b>AIP (Scopus
                Indexed), USA and Nova Publishers, USA.</b>
